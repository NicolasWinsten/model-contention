## ancillary tools

### msr-safe
https://github.com/LLNL/msr-safe

variorium may not work without msr-safe because these tools require manipulating model specific registers

### variorium
https://github.com/LLNL/variorum

Building variorium will produce simple executables for disabling/enabling turbo.
This is important for gathering meaningful measurements by disallowing dynamic changes to core frequency.

### CAT
Cache allocation technology can be leveraged using the `pqos` command. This allows you to set degrees of isolation and capacity that an app has in the cache.


## setup
Note: you will need root access to make use of this repo
(this is just the steps I take)

### enabling hugepages
To enable hugepages, we make changes to the grub file:

```
# backup the grub file just in case...
cp /etc/default/grub grub.bak
# modify this script to change the number/size of hugepages
./set_hugepage_bootparams.sh
```

after a reboot, do the following to verify the changes:
```
awk '/HugePages_Total|Hugepagesize/ {print $0}' /proc/meminfo
```

### msr-safe
Follow the instructions at https://github.com/LLNL/msr-safe.
(You will need to clone the repository outside of octomore -- on cztb2 for example -- and continue the setup on octomore)

For what we need out of variorium, we need to adjust the msr_allowlist.
```
# I go overkill and set all the bits on msr 1A0 because I don't know which exact bits are necessary
sed -i.bak 's/^0x000001A0.*$/0x000001A0 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF/' /dev/cpu/msr_allowlist
```

### variorium
https://github.com/LLNL/variorum

Like before, follow the setup instructions but clone the repo outside of octomore.
Once built, there will be an executable in the examples directory thatcan be used to enable/disable turbo.

### determining characteristics of the cache
at least on octomore, the following command will provide info on the cache hierarchy.
Together with `lscpu`, it should provide enough understanding:
```
getconf -a | grep CACHE
```
